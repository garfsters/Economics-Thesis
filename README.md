# Economics Thesis
### Abstract 
I wrote a paper that studies how parental income affects a childâ€™s chance of getting higher education. Using data from the IPUMS Current Population Survey (2009-2019), I applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression while controlling for age, gender, race, and marital status. Results show that higher parental income increases the chance of a child completing higher education, but the effect decreases over time. These findings highlight the impact of family income on educational opportunities.

Soon, I will continue on this research working on finding out the combined effects of parental income and parental education on childs higher education.
